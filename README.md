# OCproject: Dice Game 🎲

This is a browser-based Dice Game built as part of an online JavaScript course. It simulates a two-player dice roll using DOM manipulation and random number generation. I customized the game to include a button-triggered roll and dynamic image updates for a smoother user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Two-player dice roll simulation
- ✅ Random number generation using `Math.random()`
- ✅ Dynamic dice image updates (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`)
- ✅ Winner logic displayed in the heading
- ✅ Button-triggered gameplay (`#play` button)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to simulate dice rolls
- How to dynamically update image `src` attributes in the DOM
- How to use conditional logic to compare values and display results
- How to attach event listeners to buttons for interactive gameplay

## 📦 Files

- `index.html` — contains dice images, heading, and play button
- `style.css` — optional styling for layout and visuals
- `script.js` — contains all game logic and DOM manipulation

## 🛠️ How to Play

1. Click the **Play** button.
2. Each player rolls a virtual die (1–6).
3. The dice images update to reflect the roll.
4. The game displays the winner or a draw message at the top.

## 📚 Notes

This project was built as part of an online course and customized to reflect my own learning. I added a button-based trigger instead of relying on page refresh, making the game more interactive and user-friendly.
